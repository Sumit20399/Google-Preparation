/*
You are given a list of logs that represent friendship events. Each log is a triplet: [timestamp, personA, personB],
indicating that personA and personB became friends at timestamp.
There are n people labeled from 0 to n-1. A person is friends with themselves and anyone in the same connected friendship group.

Your task:
Return the earliest timestamp at which all people became friends (i.e., there is one connected component). If it is not possible, return -1.

âœ… Example:
Input:
logs = [[20190101,0,1],[20190104,3,4],[20190107,2,3],[20190211,1,5],
        [20190224,2,4],[20190301,0,3],[20190312,1,2]]
n = 6
Output: 20190301
Because at that timestamp, everyone is connected through some path of friendships.
